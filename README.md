Hanoi
=====

My first python program, a little text-based Towers of Hanoi game.

Starting the game
-----------------

1.  Run the game with "python hanoi.py".
2.  Input how many disks you want to use.  Three disks or less is too easy.  Four to six is reasonable, seven takes a good player a few minutes to win, eight or more gets to be quite a chore.
3.  A game board will be displayed.  All the disks are stacked on the left post at first.
4.  Your goal is to move the stack to the right post.
5.  The catch:  you have to move one disk at a time, from the top of the stack on a post to the top of the stack (if any) on another post.  And you can't stack a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
6.  You move a disk by inputting the post FROM which to move a disk, and the post TO which to move it.
7.  If you try to move from an empty post, or to a post with a smaller disk on it, or enter an invalid post number, you will get a helpful error message.
8.  Winning requires planning ahead.  You will get the hang of it!  Enjoy!
